#Overview#
This Python script offers a versatile alarm clock solution, allowing users to set personalized alarms with an accompanying sound alert. The script provides a simple command-line interface for inputting alarm times and employs the winsound module to play a specified sound file asynchronously when the alarm triggers.

#Key Features#
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use command-line interface prompts users to input alarm times in the HH:MM:SS format.
Customizable Sound: The alarm sound is easily customizable by replacing the "sound.wav" file with any preferred sound file in the WAV format.
Precision Timekeeping: The script utilizes Python's datetime module to precisely check and match the current time against the set alarm time.
12-Hour Format Support: Users can specify alarm times using the 12-hour clock format with AM/PM distinction for added convenience.
Asynchronous Sound Playback: The winsound module is used with the SND_ASYNC flag to ensure the sound plays without blocking the script execution.
#Usage#
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment.
Set Alarm Time: Input the desired alarm time when prompted, following the HH:MM:SS format.
Alarm Trigger: The script will continuously monitor the current time, and when it matches the set alarm time, the specified sound will play.
#Customization#
Sound File Replacement: Replace the default "sound.wav" file with any WAV-formatted sound file of your choice.
Script Modification: Customize the script to fit your preferences or integrate additional features.
#Dependencies#
Python 3.x
Windows Operating System (due to the use of the winsound module)
